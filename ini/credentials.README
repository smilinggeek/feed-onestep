There is a credentials.ini file that looks like this.
That file is not included in the git repository since adding credentials to a public git repository is silly.
--- cut here ---
; this file is ignored by git - credentials should NOT be public!
[credentials]
user = someuser
pass = somepassword
url = url-to-xml-handler
; and anything else we need...
